# Advanced-Learning-Algorithms

About this Course

In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

• Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
• Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
• Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. In this beginner-friendly program, you will learn the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.
